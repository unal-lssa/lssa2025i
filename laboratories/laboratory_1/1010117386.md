### Description of Architecture Elements:

- The software system follows the event driven architecture style.

- In Kafka, all **components** interact with each other through a custom binary protocol over TCP **connector**. This is for efficiency, speed and high throughput.

- Producer **components** only communicate with the Kafka Cluster.

- Consumers, which are part of a Kafka Consumer Group, only communicate with the Kafka Cluster.

- The Kafka Cluster is a collection of Kafka Broker components.

- Kafka Brokers also are aware and communicate with each other through the same custom TCP connectors.

- Kafka Brokers store information received from Kafka Producers in form of Kafka Topics, which themselves are stored as Kafka Partitions on file system. This is the inner behaivor of Kafka Brokers, which is the reason why Kafka Topics and Partitions are not specified in C&C View.
