## Architectural analysis

### **Architectural Style**
Kubernetes is primarily based on a "microservices" architecture. This architectural style is characterized by the following features:
- **Modularity**: The system is divided into small, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
- **Loose Coupling**: Each service communicates with others through well-defined APIs, allowing for flexibility and ease of integration.
- **Scalability**: Services can be scaled independently based on demand, making it easier to handle varying workloads.
- **Resilience**: The system can continue to function even if some services fail, as they are designed to be fault-tolerant.
- **Technology Diversity**: Different services can be built using different technologies, allowing teams to choose the best tools for their specific needs.

### **Component & connector view**
The component and connector view of Kubernetes can be represented by the following main components:
1. **Kubernetes API Server**: The central management entity that exposes the Kubernetes API. It is responsible for handling RESTful requests and updating the state of the cluster.
2. **etcd**: A distributed key-value store that stores all cluster data, including configuration and state information.
3. **Kubelet**: An agent that runs on each node in the cluster, responsible for managing the containers and ensuring they are running as expected.
4. **Kube-Proxy**: A network proxy that maintains network rules on nodes, allowing for communication between services.
5. **Controller Manager**: A component that manages controllers, which are responsible for regulating the state of the cluster.
6. **Scheduler**: A component that assigns work to nodes based on resource availability and other constraints.

### **Description of architecture**
1. **Control Plane**: 
    The control plane is responsible for managing the Kubernetes cluster. It includes components like the API server, etcd, controller manager, and scheduler. These components work together to maintain the desired state of the cluster and ensure that workloads are distributed efficiently.
    - **API Server (`api`)**: Central communication hub exposing the Kubernetes API.
    - **Controller Manager (`c-m`, `c-c-m`)**: Ensures the cluster state matches the desired configuration.
    - **Scheduler (`sched`)**: Assigns workloads (pods) to worker nodes.
    - **etcd (`etcd`)**: Distributed key-value store maintaining cluster data.
2. **Worker nodes**:
    These are the machines that execute containerized workloads. Components include:
    - **Kubelet (`kubelet`)**: Agent ensuring pods run as expected.
    - **Kube Proxy (`k-proxy`)**: Manages network rules for services and pods.
