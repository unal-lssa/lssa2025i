### General Description

Netflix is a benchmark for scalable, resilient, and high-performance architecture, operating globally with millions of concurrent users. Its infrastructure relies on microservices, cloud computing, and optimized content distribution.

### Architecture Style 

Netflix uses a cloud-native microservices architecture built on AWS.
- Each microservice handles a specific responsibility (auth, billing, recommendations, streaming).
- Services are developed with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Netty.
- Microservices Architecture

### Key Characteristics of Netflix Architecture

    -  Netflix uses a global network of CDNs to deliver content efficiently.
    -  Load balancing happens at multiple layers
    -  Hystrix (Circuit Breaker): Prevents cascading failures when a service fails
    -  Cassandra (NoSQL): Distributed, high-throughput storage.
	-  DynamoDB: Fast access to structured metadata.
	-  Elasticsearch: Real-time search and analytics.
	-  S3 / Glacier: Durable object storage for media assets.
    - Apache Kafka and Spark: Real-time data pipelines and processing.
    - IAM: Fine-grained control over service access

## Large Scale Architecture on Netflix

    - Over 700 microservices, each handling specific domains (authentication, recommendations, billing, etc.).
    - Services are loosely coupled, independently deployable, and built primarily with Java, Spring Boot, and Node.js.
    - Uses REST/gRPC APIs for service-to-service communication.
    - Supports horizontal scaling based on load.

         * Cloud infrastructure

            - Netflix runs entirely on AWS.
            - Uses Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) and Elastic Load Balancers (ELB).
            - Multi-region deployment with cross-region failover
            - Relies on Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), S3, DynamoDB, and CloudFront.

### Components Description

    - Kafka is Netflix’s backbone for real-time data streaming. It enables decoupled microservices to publish and subscribe to high-volume event data, such as playback events, user interactions, and logging information. Kafka allows asynchronous communication, fault tolerance, and scalability in data pipelines and analytics workflows.

    - Load Balancers at Netflix serve to distribute incoming traffic evenly across thousands of application instances running in different AWS availability zones. This ensures high availability, fault tolerance, and optimized latency by directing users to the healthiest and nearest backend services.

    - Amazon Redshift is used by Netflix as a centralized data warehouse solution for offline analytics and reporting. It supports complex analytical queries over massive volumes of structured data, enabling business intelligence teams to generate insights about user behavior, content performance, and operational metrics.

    - Zuul (or Envoy) acts as the edge API Gateway for Netflix’s microservices. It handles dynamic request routing, load balancing, authentication, and service discovery. It also supports traffic shaping, versioned API deployment, and security enforcement before traffic hits the core services.

    - Cassandra is Netflix’s choice for a distributed, NoSQL database optimized for high availability and fast writes. It stores critical data such as user preferences, playback history, device information, and session states. Its masterless architecture allows Netflix to scale globally with resilience to failures.

    - Amazon S3 is the object storage layer where Netflix stores unstructured data like logs, metadata, machine learning models, backups, and configuration files. It provides virtually unlimited storage with high durability, making it essential for backend services and data processing.

    - Open Connect CDN is Netflix’s custom-built content delivery network designed to cache and deliver video content closer to the user. By installing servers inside ISP networks, Netflix reduces bandwidth usage, improves video load times, and ensures smoother streaming experiences worldwide.
