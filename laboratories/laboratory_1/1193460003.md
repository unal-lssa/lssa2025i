# Monolith To Cloud-Native Transformation | Food Delvery App

This is a project developed for educational purposes that explains how to migrate/transform a monolith into microservices, for an food delivery business context, where modules were created with well-isolated and defined responsibilities so that they can be decoupled from each other as independent components and communicate with each other, acting as a large mesh of nodes.
