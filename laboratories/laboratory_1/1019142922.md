## Project

The [LHCb](https://home.cern/science/experiments/lhcb) is one of the four main detectors at the LHC (Large Hadron Collider). It's main goal is to study the CP violation and other rare phenomena in beauty hadron decays.

In order to accomplish this goal, LHCb needs to process, filter and analyze the data of around 40 Million collisions read by the detector every second. In this document I'll do a high level overview of the architecture that supports operations of this experiment.
