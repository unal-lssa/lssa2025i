# Laboratory 1 - Design

**Full name:** Ivan Andres Lemus Moreno
**Project name:** Apache Kafka
**Project repository:** https://github.com/apache/kafka
**Project description:** Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform used by thousands of companies for high-performance data pipelines, streaming analytics, data integration, and mission-critical applications.

## 2. Components

- **Producer:** Publishes messages to Kafka topics.	

- **Consumer:** Subscribes to topics and reads messages.

- **Broker:** A Kafka server that stores data and serves clients.

- **Partition:** An ordered, immutable sequence of messages within a topic.	

- **ZooKeeper:** Manages cluster metadata and broker coordination (leader election).

## 3. Architectural Patterns

### Pub/Sub Messaging
Kafka implements the publish-subscribe pattern through topics, which act as dedicated event channels. Producers send messages to topics without knowledge of the consumers, while consumers subscribe to topics of interest, enabling complete decoupling between data producers and consumers. This asynchronous communication model enables flexible, scalable architectures in which new consumers can be added without changing producers, and each message can be processed by multiple independent consumer groups.

### Horizontal Scaling
Kafka achieves elastic scalability through partitioning and distributed brokers. Topics are divided into partitions that can be distributed across multiple servers, allowing both storage and processing load to be distributed. Consumers in the same group parallelize processing by each handling a subset of partitions, while additional brokers can be added to the cluster to increase throughput and storage capacity linearly. This design allows Kafka to handle everything from small deployments to Internet-scale workloads.

### Fault Tolerance
Kafka provides high availability and durability through its replication mechanism. Each partition has multiple replicas across different brokers, with a designated leader handling reads/writes and followers maintaining copies. The In-Sync Replicas (ISR) set keeps track of sufficiently caught-up followers, enabling automatic leader election if the current leader fails. Combined with configurable Acknowledgement Requirements (Acks), this provides flexible durability guarantees from fire-and-forget to fully quorum-acknowledged writes.

## 4. Core Capabilities

### High Throughput
Deliver messages at network limited throughput using a cluster of machines with latencies as low as 2ms.

### Scalable
Scale production clusters up to a thousand brokers, trillions of messages per day, petabytes of data, hundreds of thousands of partitions. Elastically expand and contract storage and processing.

### Permanent storage
Store streams of data safely in a distributed, durable, fault-tolerant cluster.

### High availability
Stretch clusters efficiently over availability zones or connect separate clusters across geographic regions.
