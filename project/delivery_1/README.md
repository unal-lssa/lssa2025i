**Large-Scale Software Architecture, 2025i**<br>
Jeisson Andr√©s Vergara Vargas

# Project - Delivery 1

## 1. Objective

The objective of the first delivery of the project is to architecturally design a large-scale software system from a structural point of view.

## 2. Activities

* Meet by project teams.
* Select one of the four types of large-scale software systems studied.
* Define a domain that frames the functional properties of the system to be designed.
* Create a metamodel that allows abstracting the characteristics of the system to be designed.
* Create a set of transformation rules that allow for the automatic generation of the skeleton and a first prototype of the designed system.
* Create a model of the system, from the metamodel, in order to execute the transformation rules.

## 3. Considerations

* The design should be carried out from an architectural perspective, focusing on the system's main structure. **Key aspect:** architectural style.
* The design must consider the special characteristics of the type of large-scale system selected.

## 4. Delivery

### 4.1. Deliverable

* Description of each one of the following elements: software system context, metamodel, transformation rules, model, skeleton and prototype. Additionally, the file must include the instructions (commands) for executing the process.
* Associated files for executing the process: metamodel, transformation rules, model and others (e.g. configuration files for deployment).

### 4.2. Submission Format

* The deliverable must be submitted via GitHub ([lssa2025i](https://github.com/unal-lssa/lssa2025i) repository).
* Steps:
  - Use the branch corresponding to your team (team1, team2, ...).
  - In the folder [project/delivery_1](), create an **X** folder (where X = the name of the system), which must include the **deliverable**:
    + README.md with the full names of the team members and the description of the elements.
    + Associated files.

### 4.3. Delivery Deadline

Monday, April 28, 2025, before 23h59.
