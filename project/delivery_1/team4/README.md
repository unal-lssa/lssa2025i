# Project Delivery 1 - Online Real-Time Tic-Tac-Toe Platform

The proposed software system is a real-time, online multiplayer platform that allows users to play the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe or some variants from their web browsers or mobile devices. This platform operates in a concurrent environment, where multiple users can connect, interact, and play games simultaneously.

The system must handle multiple ongoing matches, real-time data synchronization between clients, and user sessions. To ensure a smooth user experience, it requires a robust server-side component that manages game state consistency, conflict resolution, and communication between users.

This system must be scalable to support a growing number of concurrent users, and resilient to handle failures gracefully (e.g., a user disconnects mid-game).

## Metamodel

This metamodel describes the structural architecture of a real-time multiplayer TicTacToe system. It supports modeling the main components and the types of connectors between them, using a simple DSL built with textX.

### Grammar Overview

### Model

- Represents the root element (`architecture`)
- Contains a list of elements (components and connectors)

### Component

- Represents a software element that performs a specific function.
- Attributes:
  - `type`: semantic classification (`frontend`, `service`, `database`, etc.)
  - `name`: unique identifier

### Connector

- Represents a connection between two components.
- Attributes:
  - `type`: interaction medium (`http`, `web_socket`, etc.)
  - `from_`: source component
  - `to_`: destination component

### Component types

| Type                | Description                                                                                              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `frontend`          | User interface component, typically running in the browser or mobile app.                                |
| `gateway`           | Entry point to backend services; handles routing, authentication, and request forwarding.                |
| `service`           | Core logic or application component; performs specific tasks such as matchmaking or game logic.          |
| `real-time-service` | Application component to handle interaction between the frontend and the broker during a game.           |
| `broker`            | Messaging mediator that supports publish-subscribe communication (e.g., MQTT, Kafka, Redis).             |
| `queue`             | Manages message queues for asynchronous processing (e.g., RabbitMQ, Azure Queue).                        |
| `cache`             | Fast, volatile storage for temporary data (e.g., Redis) used to improve performance.                     |
| `database`          | Persistent storage system for long-term data retention and queries (e.g., PostgreSQL).                   |
| `loadbalancer`      | Distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances of a service for scalability and fault tolerance. |

### Connector types

| Type               | Description                                                                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `http`             | Standard REST or HTTP-based communication between components.                            |
| `web_socket`       | Bidirectional real-time connection, often used for live interactions (e.g., game moves). |
| `queue_connector`  | Connector to a queue system for message sending/receiving.                               |
| `broker_connector` | Subscription-based connector to a messaging broker for event-driven communication.       |
| `db_connector`     | Access path from a component to a database (e.g., SQL query interface).                  |
| `internal_call`    | Internal, synchronous communication between backend components.                          |

### Design Notes

- This metamodel intentionally omits ports and low-level interaction details for simplicity.
- It supports quick modeling and visualization of software architectures with low overhead.

## Transformations

The corresponding transformations for the different component types follow the next structure:

- In the templates folder, the different files and folders for each component type template are stored.

- In the transformations folder we have a file name templates.py, in this file we have three different util functions for handling the templates during the different transformations.

  - \_make_dir: Create the storage location for a given component.

  - \_copy_template: Copy the file and folder structure of a given component template into the component directory. Replace into the template files the different parameters given as input.

  - generate_templated_component: Use \_make_dir and \_copy_template functions to create a component.

- In the transformations folder, there is a transformation file for each component, each of these files implements a function that decorates over the generate_templated_component function for each particular case.

- In the **init**.py file inside the transformations folder the apply_transformations functions are specified. In this function, given a model, we iterate over each of its components and connectors. Calling the corresponding transformation for each component, passing the different connections as parameters for each component in the model.
